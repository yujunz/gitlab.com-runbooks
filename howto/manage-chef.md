# Managing Chef

## Add a user to the chef server

To add a user you will need ssh and root access to the chef server.

The steps to create a new chef user are:

* ssh into the chef server
* run `sudo -i chef-server-ctl user-create username Firstname Surname gitlab_email $(openssl rand -hex 20)`
* copy the private key generated by chef for this user.
* add the user to gitlab organization `chef-server-ctl org-user-add gitlab _username_`

If you have a last name with spaces in it, the `chef-server-ctl user-create`
wrapper has a parsing bug. You can work around it like this.

```
sudo /opt/opscode/embedded/bin/knife opc user create username\
Firstname 'Surname With Spaces' gitlab_email $(openssl rand -hex 20)\
-c /etc/opscode/pivotal.rb
```

## Grant chef admin rights to a user

This is done locally by another chef admin:

* run `knife actor map` to update the user list
* run `knife group add actor admins _username_` to add the user
* run `knife group show admins` to check that the user is in the admin group

## Rotate chef key

To do this it will be necessary to create a new keypair. Because of how chef behaves the key has to be called _default_

* ssh into the chef server
* run `sudo -i chef-server-ctl remove-user-key _username_ default` to remove the default.
* run `sudo -i chef-server-ctl add-user-key _username_ default` to create a new default key.
* copy the private key generated by chef for this user.

If _default_ is not declared chef will use the fingerprint of the key as a name.
This will end up breaking chef execution as it will not be able of finding this key.
To check if the user is correctly setup after the key rotation run this command:
```
$ bundle exec knife user show _username_
display_name: NAME
email:        gitlab email
first_name:   _Firstname_
last_name:    _Surname_
middle_name:
public_key:   -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
XXXX
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

username:     _username_
```

if the _public\_key_ field is missing it means that the key will not be found by chef.

## Remove a chef key from the server

* run `chef-server-ctl delete-user-key USERNAME default`

## Troubleshoot chef weirdness

Some times you need to understand why a `knife` command fails with ruby errors.
The best way to figure out what is going on is to enable debugging output for the knife commnand:

`bundle exec knife user -VV show _username_`

This will dump a lot of output, and in case of a ruby exception it will also print the full trace.

Another interesting step to run when troubleshooting is checking what commands were sent to chef, to do so just grep nginx access log for relevant information

For ex, search accions performed by a given user:
```
grep '"janedoe"' /var/log/opscode/nginx/access.log
```

Then look for POST or PUT methods to sample changes.
