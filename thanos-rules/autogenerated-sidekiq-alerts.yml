      title: Sidekiq jobs are being enqueued without being dequeued
      description: |
        The `{{ $labels.queue }}` queue appears to have jobs being enqueued without
        those jobs being executed.

        This could be the result of a Sidekiq server configuration issue, where
        no Sidekiq servers are configured to dequeue the specific queue.
